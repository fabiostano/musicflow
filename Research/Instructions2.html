        <h4>Imagine the following scenario:</h4>
        <p>You are at work and have a meeting coming up in 10 minutes where you will discuss a certain topic with
            your team.</p>
        <p>You have found an academic paper that contains everything you need to know for your meeting but didn't
            find the time to read it yet.</p>
        <p>For the next 10 minutes, your task will be to read and summarize this paper, by taking notes on the side.
            Your goal is, to be prepared for the hypothetical meeting as well as possible.</p>
        <p>After 10 minutes are over, you will be automatically sent to the next page.</p>
        <p>Your notes will be checked automatically, and you will be rewarded with 2,50 EUR additional payout, if
            your notes meets the acceptance criteria.</p>
        <p>It is not necessary to write a complete, grammatically perfect summary. Your notes will pass the check
            if it is clear, that you have genuinely tried to give your best effort to prepare for the meeting. </p>
