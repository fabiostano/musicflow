        <h4> Music Rating Task </h4>
        <p>
            In this task, you will listen to <b>30 samples from songs</b> that were all released roughly a year ago.
            Each sample will be <b>25 seconds</b> long.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>During</b> these 25 seconds, you have the option to add the current song to your playlist if you like it.
            After you added the song, you don't have the option to remove it again. Only add songs that you would like to
            listen to again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>After</b> the 25 seconds are over, you need to rate the song on a scale from 1 (Very Bad) to 7 (Very Good) according to
            your <b>personal opinion</b>. This does <b>not</b> need to be an "objective" rating, we are interested in your personal taste.
            You will additionally be asked how you feel after listening to the song.
        </p>
        <p> In every second round you will get more in-depth questions about how the music made you feel. Please always try to state
        your honest opinion.</p>
        <p> In the end of the study, you will <b>receive the playlist</b> that you have created, so you can actually discover new music for yourself. </p>
