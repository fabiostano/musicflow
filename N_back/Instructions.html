        <h4> Scenario:</h4>
        <p> You just came back to work from a vacation, and you email inbox is full of unread mail. </p>
        <p> Since there was a bug in the IT System of your company, some mails have been delivered twice. </p>
        <p> To make things easier, you decide to first go through all the subject lines and delete duplicates. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-container">
        <h4>Task:</h4>
        <p>Over the next 10 minutes, your task will be to go through email subject lines one by one and decide whether
        it is a duplicate or not.</p>
        <p>A mail is considered a duplicate, if the mail directly before had the exact same subject line.</p>
        <p>You don't have to remember all the other mails, and only check for each mail if the current subject line
            is the same as the one before.</p>
